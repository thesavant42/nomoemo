  - Added _build_emoji_regex() method with comprehensive pattern matching
- **Impact**: Core detection capability for all emoji types

### Task 4: Build File Processing Logic ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Implemented file and directory processing with recursive search capabilities
  - Handle both single files and directory trees
  - Include proper file extension filtering and binary file detection to avoid processing non-text files
  - Added _should_process_file() method with comprehensive file type checking
  - Updated to process hidden directories (removed filtering of files/directories starting with '.') for comprehensive Linux compatibility
- **Impact**: Robust file handling with Linux hidden directory support

### Task 5: Create Emoji Cataloging System ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Implemented emoji discovery and cataloging functionality for --dry-run mode
  - Track file locations, line numbers, column positions, and emoji types found
  - Generate detailed reports showing exactly where emojis are located
  - Added _scan_file_for_emojis() method with detailed emoji tracking
- **Impact**: Comprehensive emoji location reporting for debugging

### Task 6: Implement Emoji Removal Logic ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Created the --remove functionality that can safely delete emoji characters from files while preserving file encoding and structure
  - Handle edge cases like emojis at line boundaries or multiple consecutive emojis
  - Added _remove_mode() method with safe file modification
- **Impact**: Safe emoji removal capability

### Task 7: Build Emoji Replacement System ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Implemented --replace functionality with proper validation of replacement characters
  - Added validation to ensure replacement character is ASCII-safe and handle the --replacement parameter validation (single character, not empty, not another emoji)
  - Tested replacement with different characters (* and X) successfully
  - Integrated with existing file processing and emoji detection systems
- **Impact**: Flexible emoji replacement with validation

### Task 8: Add Interactive Confirmation System ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Created user confirmation prompts for destructive operations
  - Implemented the multi-stage confirmation shown in the mockup ('Delete Emojis? (y/N)' followed by 'Are you SURE? (y/N)')
  - Bypass confirmations when --force flag is used
  - Tested confirmation system for both remove and replace modes
- **Impact**: Safe user interaction for destructive operations

### Task 9: Implement Logging System ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Created comprehensive logging with support for --quiet, --verbose, and --log options
  - Log to both console and optional log file with proper log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
  - Implemented structured output formatting with [LEVEL] prefixes
  - Tested quiet mode (minimal output), verbose mode (detailed output), and file logging
- **Impact**: Flexible output control for different use cases

### Task 13: Create Help and Documentation ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Implemented comprehensive --help output with usage examples
  - Updated README.md with actual usage instructions, installation steps, and examples
  - Added man page (nomoemo.1) for Unix systems
  - Created troubleshooting guide (TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
  - Created changelog (CHANGELOG.md) documenting development progress
  - Added comprehensive GitHub Actions integration guide to README
- **Impact**: Complete documentation suite for users and developers

### Task 14: Add CI/CD Integration Features ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Designed script to work well in CI/CD pipelines with appropriate exit codes, machine-readable output options, and silent operation modes
  - Implemented complete GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/emoji-check.yml)
  - Added pull request, push, and manual workflow triggers
  - Included comprehensive integration documentation for other projects
- **Impact**: Automated emoji checking in development workflows

### Character Set Compliance Checking ✅
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Details**:
  - Added --ascii-only mode to scan for non-ASCII characters (codepoints > 127)
  - Added --latin1-only mode to scan for extended Unicode characters (codepoints > 255)
  - Implemented _scan_file_for_charset_violations() method with detailed violation tracking
  - Added _print_charset_summary() method with compliance status reporting
  - Updated argument parser with new mutually exclusive modes
  - Enhanced help system with character set checking examples
  - Tested with various character sets to verify proper detection boundaries
- **Impact**: IDE compatibility checking for North American character sets
