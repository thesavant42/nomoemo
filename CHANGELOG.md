## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Core Functionality**: Complete emoji detection, removal, and replacement system
- **Character Set Compliance Checking**: New modes for detecting characters outside North American character sets:
  - `--ascii-only`: Scan for non-ASCII characters (codepoints > 127)
  - `--latin1-only`: Scan for extended Unicode characters (codepoints > 255)
  - Detailed violation reporting with line/column locations and Unicode codepoints
  - Compliance status reporting for IDE compatibility checking
- **Comprehensive Unicode Support**: Detects all Unicode emoji including:
  - Simple emojis (😀, 🌍, ✅)
  - Complex sequences with ZWJ (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 family emoji)
  - Skin tone modifiers (👍🏽)
  - Variation selectors and compound emoji
- **File Processing**: Support for single files and recursive directory traversal
- **Safety Features**:
  - Interactive confirmation prompts for destructive operations
  - Automatic binary file detection and skipping
  - UTF-8 encoding validation
  - Hidden file and directory processing (comprehensive coverage)
- **Flexible Output Options**:
  - Quiet mode for CI/CD pipelines
  - Verbose mode with detailed emoji locations
  - File logging capability
  - Structured output with clear status indicators
- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Comprehensive argument parsing
  - Detailed help system with examples
  - Proper exit codes for automation
- **Documentation**:
  - Complete README with installation and usage instructions
  - Man page (nomoemo.1) for Unix systems
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Comprehensive changelog
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated emoji checking
  - Pull request and push event handling
  - Manual workflow triggers with customizable options
  - Comprehensive integration guide for other projects

### Changed
- **Hidden Directory Processing**: Removed filtering of hidden files/directories (starting with '.') to ensure comprehensive emoji detection in Linux environments where hidden directories are common
- **Documentation**: Updated all documentation files to reflect hidden directory processing changes

### Technical Implementation
- **Library**: Migrated from emoji_regex to emoji library for better Unicode support
- **Architecture**: Clean object-oriented design with NoMoEmo class
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling with room for expansion
- **Testing**: Test files covering various emoji types and scenarios
- **Dependencies**: Minimal dependencies (emoji library, standard library only)

### Modes of Operation
- **Dry Run** (`--dry-run`): Scan and catalog emojis without modification
- **Remove** (`--remove`): Delete all emoji characters from files
- **Replace** (`--replace`): Replace emojis with user-specified ASCII character
- **ASCII-Only** (`--ascii-only`): Scan for non-ASCII characters (codepoints > 127)
- **Latin-1-Only** (`--latin1-only`): Scan for extended Unicode characters (codepoints > 255)

### Safety and Validation
- Replacement character validation (single ASCII character, not emoji)
- File encoding preservation
- Backup-friendly operations
- Confirmation prompts with `--force` override

### Development Status
- **Tasks 1-9, 13-14 Complete**: Core functionality, documentation, and CI/CD integration fully implemented
- **Tasks 10-12, 15 Pending**: Error handling, testing, performance optimization, and final validation
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for basic emoji elimination tasks with automated CI/CD checking
- **CI/CD Ready**: Complete GitHub Actions integration with comprehensive workflow options

### Known Limitations
- UTF-8 only (most common encoding for code files)
- No parallel processing (single-threaded)
- Basic error handling (expandable in future versions)
- No configuration file support
- No custom emoji pattern support

### Future Plans
- Enhanced error handling and edge case management
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Unit test suite and integration tests
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Additional output formats (JSON, XML)
- Configuration file support
- Custom emoji pattern definitions

## Development Notes

### Library Migration
**Before:** emoji_regex library
- Limited Unicode support
- Basic regex patterns
- Maintenance concerns

**After:** emoji library (carpedm20/emoji)
- Comprehensive Unicode emoji support
- Built-in regex generation
- Active maintenance
- Better documentation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Object-Oriented**: Clean separation of concerns with NoMoEmo class
- **Standard Library Heavy**: Minimal external dependencies
- **CLI First**: Designed for command-line usage and automation
- **Safety First**: Confirmation prompts and validation for destructive operations

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing with various emoji types
- Edge case validation (binary files, permissions, encodings)
- CI/CD compatibility testing
- Real-world codebase testing planned for future versions
