# NoMoEmo Development TODO List

This document tracks the remaining development tasks for the NoMoEmo emoji elimination tool.

## Project Status: Final Development Phase

### [PENDING] Tasks

- **Task 10: Add Error Handling and Edge Cases**
  - Implement robust error handling for file I/O operations, permission issues, encoding problems, and invalid arguments
  - Handle edge cases like empty files, binary files, very large files, and files with unusual encodings

- **Task 11: Create Test Files and Test Suite**
  - Create test files containing various emoji types (simple emoji, compound emoji with ZWJ sequences, emoji with skin tone modifiers, etc.) for testing
  - Implement unit tests covering all major functionality and edge cases

- **Task 12: Add Performance Optimizations**
  - Optimize for large codebases by implementing efficient regex patterns, file reading strategies, and memory management
  - Consider processing files in chunks for very large files and implementing parallel processing for directory traversal

- **Task 15: Final Testing and Validation**
  - Perform comprehensive testing with real codebases, various file types, different operating systems, and edge cases
  - Validate that the script works correctly with embedded systems constraints and various text encodings

## Notes

### Current Project State
- **Core Functionality**: ‚úÖ Complete (Tasks 1-9)
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete (Task 13)
- **CI/CD Integration**: ‚úÖ Complete (Task 14)
- **Remaining Work**: Error handling, testing, performance, and final validation

### Library Choice Rationale
The `emoji` library (carpedm20/emoji) was chosen over `emoji_regex` because it provides:
- More comprehensive emoji detection including complex Unicode sequences
- Built-in regex pattern generation with `get_emoji_regexp()`
- Support for ZWJ sequences, skin tone modifiers, and variation selectors
- Active maintenance and extensive documentation
- Better Unicode normalization handling

### Key Implementation Considerations
- **Unicode Complexity**: Handle multi-character emoji sequences (üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶), skin tone modifiers (üëçüèΩ), and variation selectors
- **File Safety**: Preserve encoding, handle large files, detect binary files
- **Performance**: Design for large codebases with efficient regex and parallel processing
- **CI/CD Ready**: Proper exit codes, machine-readable output, silent operation modes

### Usage Mockup Reference
```bash
./nomoemo.py --dry-run --recursive ./docs/

nomoemo.py v.0.0.1 - by savan42
Scanning for emoji...
[*] Scanning ./docs
[-] Found 13 smileys... gross!
[-] Found 4 eggplants, why?!
[+] Total: 17 emojis in 42 files.
[?] Delete Emojis? (y/N)
[?] Press Y to Delete, anything else to exit.
[!] Are you SURE? (y/N) Press Y to confirm!
[!] Confirmed. 17 files deleted.
```
